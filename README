fuc decompiler.
Requires Python 2.7+

usage: postproc.py [-h] [-o ASMOFFSET] [-g] deasm deco

positional arguments:
  deasm                 input deasm file
  deco                  output decompiled file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show help message and exit
  -o ASMOFFSET, --asmoffset ASMOFFSET
                        asm mnemonic offset
  -g, --greedy          try to encapsulate all code in functions

What it does:
insert function headers
find call addresses
generate pseudocode for store instructions
find and recognize simple control flow structures
find and label memory structures

What it can easily do:
find iowr/iost addresses
find branch conditions

What it could do with more effort:
Find loop headings
Remove instructions fully replaced by pseudocode
Generate most of the code
Recognize entangled control flow
Emulate known instructions
Take into account custom memory labels and function names
Change labels/values interactively and emulate changed versions
Support other architectures
