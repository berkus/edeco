fuc decompiler.
Requires Python 2.7+

What it does:
insert function headers
find call addresses
find store addresses in simple cases
generate pseudocode for store instructions

What it can easily do:
find load/iowr/iost addresses in simple cases
find address write/read counts/instructions

What it could do with more effort:
Find functions automatically
Find control flow: if, if..else, if (...||...)
Emulate known instructions
Find load/store values incl. arithmetics (my favorite)
Take into account custom memory labels
